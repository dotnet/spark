# What are Spark .NET Scenarios?

Scenarios are intended as a one-stop location in the repo for understanding 
various combinations of technology stacks and putting together a working 
end-to-end Spark .NET app.

# Pre-requisites

Some pre-requisites before you plan on contributing a scenario:
  1. Datasets you are using in the build scenario are public
  2. Sample of the dataset can be committed to the repo under `/scenarios/datasets`
  3. Scenario should work under the constraints of free-tiers of most cloud providers

To author a scenario, here's a structure you could use:
  ```
  - [Introduction](#introduction)
  - [Technology Stacks](#technology-stacks)
  - [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
  - [Running the App](#running-the-app)
  - [Discussion](#discussion)
  - [Insights](#insights)
  - [Venues](#venues)
  - [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)
  ```

A short description of what might go into each of these sections is given below:
  - **Introduction:** A brief introduction to what scenario is achieving.
  - **Technology Stacks:** What are the technology stacks you use in enabling the scenario.
  - Pre-requisites: Are there any pre-requisites for the user to follow?
  - Running the App: How does one run the app (e.g., locally, cloud)?
  - Discussion: Anything particularly interesting about the app you want to discuss?
  - Insights: Any results you would like to share that were derived from the analysis 
    of the full dataset? For instance, what can the user expect once they go through the analysis of this dataset.
  - Venues: Was this scenario presented at a conference?
  - Acknowledgements: Any companies/people you want to acknowledge.
