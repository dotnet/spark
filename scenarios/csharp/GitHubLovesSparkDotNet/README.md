In the **Github ðŸ’– .NET for Apache Spark** app, we dive into the world of
analyzing GitHub meta-data using .NET for Apache Spark. While the analysis
is simple, it conveys a key point of how easy it is to get started with
analyzing large datasets using .NET.

# Introduction

[GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/) monitors the [Github public event time line](https://api.github.com/events). 
For each event, it retrieves its contents and their dependencies, exhaustively. It 
then stores the data in a MySQL database. 

> **Disclaimer**: This app is purely for demonstration purposes. And more 
importantly, this was not written by a seasoned Data Scientist so please 
avoid deriving *any* conclusions from the results :) Of course, please feel 
free to open PRs to improve and make this app more interesting.
