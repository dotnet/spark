Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.,1
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!,1

Their steaks are 100% recommended!,1
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.,0
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.,1
"All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.",1
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.,0

The kids play area is NASTY!,0
Great place fo take out or eat in.,1
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.,1
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.,1

It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.,0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!,0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!,1
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.,1
Not good for the money.,0
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!,1

Very disappointing!!!,0
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.,1
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.",0
Pretty awesome place.,1
Ambience is perfect.,1
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.,0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,0

Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.,1

Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?,0
This place was such a nice surprise!,1
They were golden-crispy and delicious.,1
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.",0
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0
"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.",1
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.",1

Awful service.,0
Won't ever go here again.,0

For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,0

They were excellent.,1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.",1

I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
The service was extremely slow.,0

Seriously killer hot chai latte.,1
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.",0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,0
Worst Thai ever.,0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,1
The pizza selections are good.,1
"I had strawberry tea, which was good.",1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,0

The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!",0
#NAME?,0
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
We won't be returning.,0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
"Very, very sad.",0
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.,0

I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,0

"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.",0
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",0
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.",0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0
Disappointing experience.,0
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.",0
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
We won't be going back.,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0
This place lacked style!!,0
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.",0
Don't bother coming here.,0
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.",0
"The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.",0
It was equally awful.,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.",0
"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.",0
I was VERY disappointed!!,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.",0
Con: spotty service.,0
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",0
But then they came back cold.,0
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",0
The real disappointment was our waiter.,0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.",0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,0
But I don't like it.,0
Hell no will I go back,0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all"".",0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
The ambiance isn't much better.,0
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.",0
The food wasn't good.,0
"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.",0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.,0
"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.",0
Overpriced for what you are getting.,0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.",0
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.",0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
Food was below average.,0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.",0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0
"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.",0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0
Spend your money and time some place else.,0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0
