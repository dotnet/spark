# .NET for Apache Spark C# Samples: SQL

[.NET for Apache Spark](https://dot.net/spark) is a free, open-source, and cross-platform big data analytics framework.

In the **Sql** folder, we provide samples focusing on Spark SQL, which allows us to work with structured data. We can store and analyze data using
the `DataFrame` API and SQL queries.

There are two categories of .NET for Apache Spark Sql samples:

* **[Batch](Batch):** .NET for Apache Spark apps that analyze batch data, or data that has already been produced/stored.

* **[Streaming](Streaming):** .NET for Apache Spark apps that analyze structured streaming data, or data that is currently being produced live.
