# .NET for Apache Spark 0.4 Release Notes

### New Features and Improvements

* Revamped loading assemblies used inside UDFs ([#180](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/180))
* Support for Vector UDFs ([#127](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/127))
* Support for Grouped Map UDFs ([#143](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/143))
* Resolve the signer mismatch issue ([#186](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/186))
* Ability to launch a debugger from the worker ([#150](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/150))
* Compatibility check for Microsoft.Spark.dll in the worker ([#170](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/170))
* Update Apache.Arrow to v0.14.1 ([#167](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/167))
* Support for RuntimeConfig in SparkSession ([#184](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/184))
* Support for `Trigger` in `DataStreamWriter` ([#153](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/153))
* The ability to use `--archives` option to deploy the worker binaries and assemblies that UDFs depend on ([#187](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/187))

### Breaking Changes
* Due to the changes in loading assemblies ([#180](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/180)), the Microsoft.Spark.Worker executable is no longer compatible with the previous versions.
* The `--class org.apache.spark.deploy.DotnetRunner` option in `spark-submit` is changed to **`--class org.apache.spark.deploy.dotnet.DotnetRunner`** to resolve the signer mismatch issue ([#186](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/186)).
