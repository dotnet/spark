# .NET for Apache Spark 1.1 Release Notes

### Deprecation notice for Spark 2.3

We are planning to drop the support for Spark 2.3 in the 2.0 release, which will be the next release.
The last Spark 2.3 release (2.3.4) was back in September 2019, and no new release is planned for Spark 2.3. Since there have been no new features introduced for Spark 2.3 in the last few releases of .NET for Apache Spark, if you are relying on Spark 2.3, you should be able to continue using .NET for Apache Spark 1.x.

### Compatibility

#### Backward compatibility

The following table describes the oldest version of the worker that the current version is compatible with, along with new features that are incompatible with the worker.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Oldest compatible Microsoft.Spark.Worker version</th>
            <th>Incompatible features</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody align="center">
        <tr>
            <td>v1.0.0</td>
            <td>GroupedMap in Spark 3.0 is not compatible with Worker 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/spark/pull/654">(#654)</a>*</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
* This is not a breaking change since this feature never worked with Worker 1.0.0.
