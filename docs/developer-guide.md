## How to Do Local Debugging

### Debugging Spark .NET Application

Open a new command prompt window, run the following:
```shell
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.deploy.DotnetRunner \
  --master local \
  <path-to-microsoft-spark-jar> \
  debug
```
and you will see the followng output:
```
***********************************************************************
* .NET Backend running debug mode. Press enter to exit *
***********************************************************************
```
In this debug mode, `DotnetRunner` does not launch the .NET application, but waits for it to connect. Leave this command prompt window open.

Now you can run your .NET application with any debugger to debug your application.

### Debugging Scala code

If you need to debug the Scala side code (`DotnetRunner`, `DotnetBackendHandler`, etc.), you can use the following command, and attach a debugger to the running process using [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/attaching-to-local-process.html):

```shell
spark-submit \
  --driver-java-options -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 \
  --class org.apache.spark.deploy.DotnetRunner \
  --master local \
  <path-to-microsoft-spark-jar> \
  <path-to-your-app-exe> <argument(s)-to-your-app>
```

## How to Support New Spark Releases

We encourage developers to first read Apache Spark's [Versioning Policy](https://spark.apache.org/versioning-policy.html) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to gain the most out of the instructions below.

At a high-level, Spark's versions are: **[MAJOR].[FEATURE].[MAINTENANCE]**. We will cover the upgrade path for each type of version separately below (in increasing order of effort required).

### [MAINTENANCE]: Upgrading for a Patch Release Version
Since Apache Spark's [MAINTENANCE] releases involve only internal changes (e.g., bug fixes etc.), it is straightforward to upgrade the code base to support a [MAINTENANCE] release. The steps to do this are below:

1. In the corresponding `pom.xml`, update the `spark.version` value to the newly released version.
   * For example, if a new patch release is 2.4.3, you will update [src/scala/microsoft-spark-2.4.x/pom.xml](/src/scala/microsoft-spark-2.4.x/pom.xml) to have `<spark.version>2.4.3</spark.version>`.
2. Update `DotnetRunner.supportedSparkVersions` to include the newly released version.
   * For example, if a new patch release is 2.4.3, you will update [src/scala/microsoft-spark-2.4.x/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/DotnetRunner.scala](/src/scala/microsoft-spark-2.4.x/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/DotnetRunner.scala).
3. Update the [azure-pipelines.yml](/azure-pipelines.yml) to include E2E testing for the newly released version.

Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/dotnet/spark/commit/eb26baa46200bfcbe3e1080e650f335853d9990e) for an example.
