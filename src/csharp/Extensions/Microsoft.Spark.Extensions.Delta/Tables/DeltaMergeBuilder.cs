    /// Builder to specify how to merge data from source DataFrame into the target Delta table.
    /// You can specify 1, 2 or 3 "when" clauses of which there can be at most 2 "WhenMatched" clauses
    /// and at most 1 "WhenNotMatched" clause. Here are the constraints on these clauses.
    ///
    ///   - "WhenMatched" clauses:
    ///
    ///     - There can be at most one "update" action and one "delete" action in "WhenMatched" clauses.
    ///
    ///     - Each "WhenMatched" clause can have an optional condition. However, if there are two
    ///       "WhenMatched" clauses, then the first one must have a condition.
    ///
    ///     - When there are two "WhenMatched" clauses and there are conditions (or the lack of)
    ///       such that a row matches both clauses, then the first clause/action is executed.
    ///       In other words, the order of the "WhenMatched" clauses matter.
    ///
    ///     - If none of the "WhenMatched" clauses match a source-target row pair that satisfy
    ///       the merge condition, then the target rows will not be updated or deleted.
    ///
    ///     - If you want to update all the columns of the target Delta table with the
    ///       corresponding column of the source DataFrame, then you can use the
    ///       "WhenMatched(...).UpdateAll()". This is equivalent to
    ///     <code>
    ///         WhenMatched(...).UpdateExpr(new Dictionary<string, string>() {
    ///           {"col1", "source.col1"},
    ///           {"col2", "source.col2"},
    ///           ...})
    ///     </code>
    ///
    ///   - "WhenNotMatched" clauses:
    ///
    ///     - This clause can have only an "Insert" action, which can have an optional condition.
    ///
    ///     - If the "WhenNotMatched" clause is not present or if it is present but the non-matching
    ///       source row does not satisfy the condition, then the source row is not Inserted.
    ///
    ///     - If you want to Insert all the columns of the target Delta table with the
    ///       corresponding column of the source DataFrame, then you can use
    ///       "WhenMatched(...).InsertAll()". This is equivalent to
    ///
    ///     <code>
    ///         WhenMatched(...).InsertExpr(new Dictionary<string, string>() {
    ///             {"col1", "source.col1"},
    ///             {"col2", "source.col2"}
    ///           ...})

    /// <code>
    ///    deltaTable
    ///     .As("target")
